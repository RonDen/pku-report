  abstract  = {In this paper we present a method for finding collisions in SHA-0 which is related to differential cryptanalysis of block ciphers. Using this method, we obtain a theoretical attack on the compression function SHA-0 with complexity 261, which is thus better than the birthday paradox attack. In the case of SHA-1, this method is unable to find collisions faster than the birthday paradox. This is a strong evidence that the transition to version 1 indeed raised the level of security of SHA.},

  abstract  = {The most efficient collision attacks on members of the SHA family presented so far all use complex characteristics which were manually constructed by Wang et al. In this report, we describe a method to search for characteristics in an automatic way. This is particularly useful for multi-block attacks, and as a proof of concept, we give a two-block collision for 64-step SHA-1 based on a new characteristic. The highest number of steps for which a SHA-1 collision was published so far wasÂ 58. We also give a unified view on the expected work factor of a collision search and the needed degrees of freedom for the search, which facilitates optimization.},
